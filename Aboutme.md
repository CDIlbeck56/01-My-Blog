Hello, I am Colton Dilbeck. I was born and raised in Cassville Missouri about 20 minutes from Table Rock Lake. I have been fishing since I started walking. As a kid, I grew up fishing on Table Rock, Stockton, and Lake of the Ozarks. I also live about 8 minutes form Roaring River State park and have enjoyed fishing for trout.

My passion for fishing was inspired by my dad. My favorite fishing story occurred when I was 5. My dad took me to a pond, and I caught a 6.5 lb. Largemouth Bass. After catching that fish, I was hooked for life. As I grew older, my dad and I started fishing some local club fishing tournaments on Table Rock Lake.

In high school I joined the bass fishing team when I was a junior. The teen angler bass fishing program gave me the oppurtunity to different lakes in Missouri and other sorrounding states. After graduation at Cassville High, I started college at College of the Ozarks. College of the Ozarks sets right next to lake Taneycomo and about 6 miles or less from Table Rock Lake. So, I like to spend my free time on the lake when the weather is nice. I am not a professional fisherman. I really just enjoy fishing as a hobby and love being outdoors!
