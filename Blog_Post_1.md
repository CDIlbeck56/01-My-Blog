# Blog Post 1: What is the Purpose?

## Topic: Fishing on Lakes in Missouri and Oklahoma

The purpose of this blog is to provide information to people interested in fishing on lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri and Northeastern Oklahoma. This blog is intended for tourist or people with barely any fishing experience. The blog will use personal fishing experiences on Table Rock Lake, Stockton Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, and Grand Lake to provide information to those interested in fishing in any of these lakes. I hope my experiences will provide some helpful information and encourage people to enjoy fishing. I will share what has worked for me over the years along with some of the resources that I use. My recommendations may not work for everyone but they will atleast lead you in the right direction. This blog will give information on how to catch Black Bass, White Bass, Crappie, Blue Gill (sun fish), Flathead Catfish, and Channel Catfish on the lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri and Northeastern Oklahoma.

The blog posts will include information about the size of the lake, the type of lake, specific locations on a certain lake where I have fished, and common species of fish found in the lake. In addition, it will provide different fishing techniques, explain fish feeding habits, and explain how weather affects the movement of feeding habits of different types of fish. For someone fishing for the first time in this region, these blog posts will provide some basic knowledge and make their fishing experience more enjoyable. I have learned that each lake is uniquely designed and fishes different. I think fishing can be challenging but at the same time it can be extremely fun. 

Not everyone will pick a fishing pole on their first trip to the lake and catch a fish. I can give you the exact locations where I fish and tell you what I used to catch them; however, that dosen't mean that you can go to the same place, fish the same way, and catch fish like I have. I say this not to discourage anyone from fishing. Fishing requires lots of knowledge but that dosen't mean that it is limited to certain people. I can tell you from personal experience that every fishing trip is a different experience and if you have any interest in fishing any of these lakes follow my blog posts.
