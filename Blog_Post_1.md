# Blog Post 1: What to Expect?

## Topic: Fishing on Lakes in Missouri 

The purpose of this blog is to provide information to people interested in fishing on lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri. The blog is intended for tourist or people who barely have any fishing experience. In my blog posts, I will use personal fishing experiences on Table Rock Lake, Stockton Lake, and Lake of the Ozarks. Although, some of the fishing tips discussed in my posts are not only restricted to these lakes. I plan to share some fishing techniques that have worked for me and some of the resources that I have used to gain information. I hope my experiences will provide helpful information and make your next fishing experience more enjoyable.

I plan to have a variety of different posts on how to catch Black Bass, White Bass, Crappie, Blue Gill (sun fish), Flathead Catfish, and Channel Catfish on these lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri. My posts will also include information about the size of the lake, the type of lake, and specific locations where I have fished. In addition to providing information about the lake, I will discuss different fishing techniques, explain fish feeding habits, and explain how weather affects movement of different types of fish. I have learned that each lake is uniquely designed and fishes different. I think fishing can be challenging but at the same time it can be extremely fun.

Not everyone will pick a fishing pole on their first trip to the lake and catch a fish. I can give you the exact locations where I fish and tell you what I used to catch them; however, that doesn't mean that you can go to the same place, fish the same way, and catch fish like I have. I say this not to discourage anyone from fishing. Fishing requires lots of knowledge but that doesn't mean that it is limited to certain people. I can tell you from personal experience that every fishing trip is a different experience and if you have any interest in fishing any of these lakes follow my blog posts!
