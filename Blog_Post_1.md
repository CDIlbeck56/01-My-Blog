# Blog Post 1: Introductory Post

## Topic: Fishing on Lakes in Missouri and Oklahoma

The purpose of this blog is to provide information to people interested in fishing on lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri and Northeastern Oklahoma. This blog is for tourist interested in fishing in this region or local people that have little experience fishing this region. The blog will use personal fishing experiences on Table Rock Lake, Stockton Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, and Grand Lake to provide information to those interested in fishing in any of these lakes. I hope the stories provide some helpful information and encourage people to enjoy fishing and being in the outdoors. This blog will give information on how to catch Black Bass, White Bass, Crappie, Blue Gill (sun fish), Flathead Catfish, and Channel Catfish on the lakes in Central/Southwest Missouri and Northeastern Oklahoma.

The blog posts will include information about specific locations on a certain lake, the size of the lake, the type of lake, and common species of fish found in the lake. In addition, it will provide different fishing techniques, explain fish feeding habits, and explain how weather affects the movement of feeding habits of different types of fish. For someone fishing for the first time in this region these blog posts will provide some basic knowledge that will make their first fishing experience more enjoyable. Each lake is uniquely designed and fishes different and that is what makes fishing a challenge and a sport. 

Fishing is a sport that can be rather challenging. Not everyone will pick a fishing pole on their first trip to the lake and catch a fish. I say this not to discourage anyone from fishing. Fishing requires lots of knowledge but that dosen't mean that it is limited to certain people. I can tell you from personal experience that every fishing trip is a different experience and if you have any interest in fishing this region follow my blog post.
