# Catching Crappie during the Spawn on Stockton Lake

Lake of the Ozarks is located in central Missouri and is arguably one of the best Crappie fishing lakes around. Lake of the Ozarks is the second largest lake in the State of Missouri and one of the most popular lakes in Missouri. The lake has several river channels that flow together. My favorite area of the lake to fish is the south part in the Niangua arm.

The hardest part about catching Crappie on Lake of the Ozarks is finding where they are located in the water. In early spring and fall Crappie like to live in or around cover. They live in brush piles, next to big rocks, under docks, or next to standing timber. When the lake water is around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the Crappie can be found around those types of structures in 3-10ft of water. Crappie move into the shallower water and around structure to *spawn*. *Spawning* is just a fancy word for their reproduction process. The Missouri department of Conservation has a map of the lake with some of these structures marked. If you would like to look at the map, click on this link fish.mdc.mo.gov. The female Crappie will lay their eggs around structure, and the males will come fertilize the eggs. In my opinion, Crappie fishing is the best during the spawn because they are easy to locate and are aggressive feeders. In the other parts of the year, Crappie move into deeper water and are harder to locate and catch. Crappie like to feed on tiny insects, small bait fish, and other crustaceans. When fishing for Crappie, I try to use a bait that looks similar their food source.

An ultra-light fishing rod and a spinning reel is preferred for Crappie fishing. You will want a rod that is sensitive because you want to feel them bite your lure. On the reel, I prefer a 6 lb. fishing line or less. In addition, you will need some panfish hooks with a long shank. Crappie have small mouths and will not be able to swallow a big hook. The long shank will help you get the hook out of their mouth after you catch a one. My favorite bait for catching spawning Crappie are live minnows. You hook the minnow about an 1/8 of an inch back from its lips. The hook needs to go through the top of their body and out the bottom of the minnow. Then, you cast the minnow around the structure of the water and reel slow. With a sensitive rod and light line, you will feel them eat the minnow. You can also catch them shallow on small plastic jigs, hair jigs, and small spinner baits.
