# Night Fishing for Largemouth During the Summer on Table Rock Lake

The bass start to move back into deeper water after they spawn. The fish lose lots of body weight during the spawn due to their increased activity during reproduction. After they spawn, they are looking for a good reliable food source to replenish their bodies. They like to find brush piles, stumps, big rocks, or ledges on bluffs in the deeper water. They search for these structures and use them for shelter and food. Bass will feed of the pan-fish like Perch and Crappie that live in or around those structures. They will also feed on small bait fish like shad and craw fish.

The water gets warmer as the summer progresses. The warming water temperature also causes the bass to move deeper. Bass prefer a water temperature that remains constant. Bass don't like warmer water because there is less oxygen in warmer water. In the lake, the depth at which the water temperature stays consistent is referred to as the thermocline. The depth to thermocline varies depending on how hot the summer is and how warm the lake water gets. In order to be successful at bass fishing in the summer, one must find structure that is around the depth of thermocline and has a food source for the bass.

People fish at night for bass in the summer because the summer nights are cooler and more pleasant for fishing. I really enjoy night fishing in the summer because there are less people on the lake at night, and you don't have the heat from the sun. The only downfall to fishing at night is that you need a source of light. Lights attract the bugs on the lake and that gets rather annoying but other than that the fishing is peaceful. I don't have a favorite spot to fish on Table Rock during the summer. I fish all areas of the lake. I rely on the electronic graphs on my boat to find underwater structures that might hold fish. The Missouri Department of Conservation posts a map of all the underwater structures and their locations. Click on the link if you would like to view the map (huntfish.mdc.mo.gov).

My favorite way to catch fish at night in the Summer is with a Texas Rig. I take a 1/4-ounce bullet sinker and slide it on my line. Then, I tie a either a #4 or #5 eagle claw worm hook onto my line. For the bait, I use a variety of different Zoom soft plastics. My two favorite Zoom soft plastics are Zoom Brush Hogs and the Zoom Ol' Monster 10-inch ribbon tailed worm. I fish these baits in three different colors emerald, black sapphire, and plum. When fishing a Texas Rig, I prefer a medium-heavy action rod. Your rod is key because it will affect your hook sets and could affect how many fish you catch. I fish the bait slow across the bottom. With a Texas Rig, you can feel the bait dragging over all the debris on the bottom of the lake. You want to pull the bait through all the debris and hopefully convince the bass to eat the bait. The Texas Rig is a Really fun way to fish, and I hope you get the opportunity to try it someday!
