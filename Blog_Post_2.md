# Fishing for Spawing Smallmouth, Spotted, and Largemouth Bass on Table Rock in the Spring

Public access areas surround Table Rock lake. The public areas are owned by Corps of Engineers and are used for camping or fishing; they also have boat ramps to launch your boat or plenty of shore line to walk while bank fishing. You can find a list of these locations by clicking on this link Recreations.gov.

While there are several places to fish on Table Rock, my favorite is the Kings River.  In early spring, I launch my boat at the Shell Knob bridge and head west into the Kings River.  The water up in the Kings River is known for being murky or stained. From late March through mid-May, the early rains make the water in the Kings River murky. When the water becomes murky, the sunlight warms it faster.

When the water starts to warm up, it is my favorite time to fish for Bass. Spring is not the only time of the year to fish for bass; however, I believe that it's the easiest time of the year to catch them. In addition, the spring weather also makes fishing more enjoyable. Spring is the time of year when bass start to move shallow. In the winter months of the year, the water is in the low forties. When the water is cold, the bass are in deeper water. When the bass are deep, they primarily feed of shad or small bait fish. As the water gets warmer, the bass will move from the deeper areas off the lake into the shallower areas. The bass will move shallow in the Kings River faster than other parts of the lake because murky water warms up faster. They start moving from deeper depths when the water gets over 50 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, their feeding habits change; they go from feeding on shad or small bait fish to feeding on a mix of crawl fish and shad.

The main purpose for their moving habits is reproduction. The reproduction process is referred to as the spawn. The male bass will move shallow into about 3-6 foot of water when the water temperature reaches 67-70 degrees Fahrenheit. The males will find gravely or rock type bottoms in the shallow water and start making beds for the females. Once they make the bed, the females will come take over the bed and lay their eggs in the bed. They will guard and protect their eggs for about a week, and the males will come fertilize the eggs. The first species of bass to move shallow and spawn are Smallmouth. Smallmouth are first because they prefer cooler water and will spawn in water temperatures in the low 60's. Spotted and Largemouth Bass spawn later than the Smallmouth. The spawn occurs on Table Rock in mid-April around a full moon.

The bass that have moved up shallow are aggressive and protective of their beds. To catch these bass, I like the use a medium-heavy action, Lews, spinning rod. I like to use 10-pound P-line for line on my rod. For bait, I use a 5/16-ounce, spot remover, shaky head. I then take a zoom brand watermelon red trick worm and screw the larger end of the worm onto the shaky head. In addition to watermelon red, I have also caught fish on green pumpkin, plum, or cotton candy colored trick worms. When I fish the shaky head, I cast out into the water and give the bait 2-3 little short hops followed by a five second pause. Then, I give the reel a few turns and do the same thing again. Shaky head fishing is only one of the many ways to catch spawning bass on Table Rock in the Spring. I hope you found something useful from my post and good luck on you next fishing trip!
