# Fishing for Smallmouth, Spotted, and Largemouth Bass on Table Rock in the Spring

I would like to start off with some basic information about Table Rock Lake. Table Rock Lake is roughly 65.5 square miles in size and is divided into three main sections. The lower section is the section is the area of the lake from the Branson dam to Kimberling City, the middle section is the area of the lake from Kimberling City to Baxter, and the upper section is the area of lake from Baxter down into the Kings River. The lake is divided into three sections because each section of the lake has different water color and structure. Public access areas surround every section of the lake. The public areas are owned by core of engineers and can be used for camping or fishing; they also have boat ramps to launch your boat or plenty of shore line to walk while bank fishing. You can find a list of these locations by searching Table Rock Lake on Recreations.gov. 

While there are several places to fish on Table Rock, my favorite is the Kings River. The Kings River is located in upper section of the lake. In early spring, I launch my boat at the Shell Knob bridge and head west down the lake and up the Kings River. This part of the lake is one the smaller and shallower areas of the lake. The water up in the Kings River is known for being muddier. From late March through mid-May, the early rains make the water in the Kings River murky. When the water becomes murky, the sunlight will warm it up  faster.

When the water starts to warm up, it is my favorite time to fish for Bass. Spring is not the only time of the year to fish for bass but in my opinion, it is the easiest time of the year to catch them. In addition, the spring weather also makes fishing more enjoyable. In the winter months of the year, the lake water is around the low forties. When the water is cold like this, the bass are in deeper water and have not moved shallow into the river arms or branches of the lake. When the bass are deep, they primarily feed of shad or small bait fish. As the water gets warmer, the bass will move from a depth of about 40 foot to 20 foot or shallower. The bass will move shallower in all sections of the lake at certain times in the year; however, they move shallower in the upper section sooner because the water warms up faster. They start moving from those deeper depths when the water gets over 50 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, their feeding habits change. Rather the feeding on shad or small bait fish, they start to feed on crawl fish. 

The main purpose for their moving habits is reproduction. The reproduction process is referred to as the *spawn*. The male bass will move shallow into about 3-6 foot of water when the water temperature reaches 67-70 degrees Fahrenheit. The males will find gravely or rock type bottoms in the shallow water and start making beds for the females. Once they make the bed, the females will come take over the bed and lay their eggs in the bed. They will guard and protect their eggs for about a week, and the males will come fertilize the eggs. The first species of bass to move shallow and *spawn* are Smallmouth. Smallmouth are first because they prefer cooler water and will *spawn* in water temperatures in the low 60's. Spotted and Largemouth Bass *spawn* after the Smallmouth The *spawn* occurs on Table Rock in mid-April around a full moon.

The bass that have moved up shallow are aggressive and protective of their beds. To catch these bass, I like the use a medium-heavy action, Lews, spinning rod. I like to use 10-pound P-line for line on my rod. For bait, I use a 5/16-ounce, spot remover, shaky head. I then take a zoom brand watermelon red trick worm and screw the larger end of the worm onto the shaky head. In addition to watermelon red, I have also caught fish on green pumpkin, plum, or cotton candy colored trick worms. When I fish the shaky head, I cast out into the water and give the bait 2-3 little short hops followed by a five second pause. Then, I give the reel a few turns and do the same thing again. Shaky head fishing is only one of the many ways to catch *spawning* bass on Table Rock in the Spring. I hope you found something useful from my post and good luck on you next fishing trip!
