# Fishing for Large Mouth Bass on Table Rock in the Spring

The spring time of the year is my favorite time to fish. The spring is also my favorite time to fish my home lake, Table Rock. Table rock lake is roughly 65.5 square miles in size. It is a freshwater lake that house several different types of fish. Table Rock lake runs along the Arkansas border in the southwest corner of Missouri. There are several public access areas located on table rock lake that are owned by core of engineers and can be used by the public for camping; they also have boat ramps to launch your boat or plenty of shore line to walk while bank fishing. You can find a list of these locations by searching Table Rock Lake on Recreations.gov. 
While there are several places to fish on Table Rock, my favorite is around the Shell Knob bridge. The Shell Knob bridge has a small boat launch ramp that anyone can launch at free of charge. In early spring I launch my boat at the Shell Knob bridge and head west down the lake and up the Kings River. This part of the lake is one the smaller and shallower areas of the lake. The Kings River is known for being muddier. In the spring, the early rains cause run off. The runoff carries sediment and other debris. When the water becomes muddy, the water is darker; therefore, the water will warm up faster than many other sections of the lake. The rain water is also warmer and contributes to the rising lake water temperature.
So, the water is starting to warm up in the Kings river in early spring, and it is my favorite time to fish for Largemouth Bass. Prior to spring the lake water is around mid to low forties, and the bass are out in the deeper waters and have not moved into shallower river arms or branches of the lake. As the water progressively get warmer, the bass will move from the depths of 40 foot or deeper to 20 foot or shallower. They start moving from those deeper depths when the water gets over 50 degrees. In addition, their feeding habits change. Rather the feeding on shad or small bait fish, they start to feed on crawl fish.
The main purpose for their moving habits is reproduction. Male bass will move shallow into about 1-2 foot of water when the water temperature reaches 67-70 degrees. The males will find gravely or rock type bottoms in the shallow water and start making beds for the females. Once they make the bed, the females will come take over the bed and lay there eggs in the bed. They will guard and protect their eggs for about a weeks time, and the males will come fertilize the eggs.
In my opinion catching Largemouth Bass is easiest during this time of the year. The Largemouth that have moved up shallow are really aggressive and protective of their beds. To catch these fish, I like the use a medium-heavy action, lews, spinning rod. I like to use 12-pound P-line for line on my rod. For fishing bait, I use a 5/16 ounce, spot remover, shaky head. I then take a watermelon red trick worm and screw the larger end of the worm onto the shaky head. In addition the watermelon red, I have also caught fish on green pumpkin, plum, or cotton candy colors trick worms. When I fish the shaky head, I cast out into the water and give the bait 2-3 little short hops followed by a five second pause. Then, I reel the line in a few turns and do the same thing again. I really enjoy fishing for Largemouth with a shaky head in the spring. I hope you found something useful from my post and good luck on you next fishing trip!
