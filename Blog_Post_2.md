# Fishing for Large Mouth Bass on Table Rock in the Spring

The spring time is my favorite time to fish. The spring is also my favorite time to fish my home lake, Table Rock. Table Rock Lake is roughly 65.5 square miles in size. It is a freshwater lake that houses several different types of fish. Table Rock Lake runs along the Arkansas border in the southwest corner of Missouri. Public access areas surround Table Rock. The public areas are owned by core of engineers and can be used by the public for camping; they also have boat ramps to launch your boat or plenty of shore line to walk while bank fishing. You can find a list of these locations by searching Table Rock Lake on Recreations.gov. 

While there are several places to fish on Table Rock, my favorite is around the Shell Knob bridge. The Shell Knob bridge has a small boat launch ramp that anyone can launch at free of charge. In early spring, I launch my boat at the Shell Knob bridge and head west down the lake and up the Kings River. This part of the lake is one the smaller and shallower areas of the lake. The water up in the Kings River is known for being muddier. From late March through mid May, the early rains cause lots of run off. The runoff carries sediment and other debris that make the water muddier or merky appearing. When the water becomes muddy, the water is darker; therefore, the water will warm up faster than many other sections of the lake.

When the water starts to warm up, it is my favorite time to fish for Bass. Spring is not the only time of the year to fish for bass but in my opinion it is the easiest time of the year to catch them. In addition, the spring weather also makes fishing more enjoyable. In the winter months of the year, the lake water is around mid to low forties. When the water is cold like this, the bass are out in the deeper waters and have not moved into shallower river arms or branches of the lake. When the bass are out deep, they primarly feed of shad or small bait fish. Bass are primarly site feeders and rely on there site to find their food. As the water progressively get warmer, the bass will move from the depths of 40 foot or deeper to 20 foot or shallower. They start moving from those deeper depths when the water gets over 50 degrees. In addition, their feeding habits change. Rather the feeding on shad or small bait fish, they start to feed on crawl fish.

The main purpose for their moving habits is reproduction. The reproduction process is reffered to as the 'spawn'. The male bass will move shallow into about 1-2 foot of water when the water temperature reaches 67-70 degrees. The males will find gravely or rock type bottoms in the shallow water and start making beds for the females. Once they make the bed, the females will come take over the bed and lay their eggs in the bed. They will guard and protect their eggs for about a weeks time, and the males will come fertilize the eggs. The first species of bass to move shallow and 'spawn' are Smallmouth. Smallmouth are first becuse they prefer cooler water. Kentuky and Largemouth Bass 'spawn' after the Smallmouth.

The bass that have moved up shallow are really aggressive and protective of their beds. To catch these bass, I like the use a medium-heavy action, lews, spinning rod. I like to use 12-pound P-line for line on my rod. For fishing bait, I use a 5/16 ounce, spot remover, shaky head. I then take a watermelon red trick worm and screw the larger end of the worm onto the shaky head. In addition to watermelon red, I have also caught fish on green pumpkin, plum, or cotton candy colors trick worms. When I fish the shaky head, I cast out into the water and give the bait 2-3 little short hops followed by a five second pause. Then, I reel the line in a few turns and do the same thing again. I really enjoy fishing for bass with a shaky head in the spring. Shaky head fishing is only one of the many ways to catch 'spawning' bass on Table Rock in the Spring. I hope you found something useful from my post and good luck on you next fishing trip!
