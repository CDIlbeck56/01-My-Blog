# Fishing for Large Mouth Bass on Table Rock in the Spring

The spring time of the year is my favorite time to fish. The spring is also my favorite time to fish my home lake, Table Rock. Table rock lake is a rather large fresh water, manmade reservoir. It is roughly 65.5 square miles. Table Rock lake runs along the Arkansas border in the southwest corner of Missouri. There are several public access areas located on table rock lake that are owned by core of engineers and can be used by the public for camping; they also have boat ramps to launch your boat or plenty of shore line to walk while bank fishing. You can find a list of these locations by searching Table Rock Lake on Recreations.gov. 
While there are several places to fish on Table Rock, my favorite is around the shell snob bridge. The Shell Knob bridge has a small boat launch ramp that anyone can launch at free of charge. In early spring I launch my boat at the Shell Knob bridge and head west down the lake and up the Kings River. This part of the lake is one the smaller and shallower areas of the lake. The Kings River is known for being muddier. In the spring, the early rains cause run off. The runoff carries sediment and other debris. When the water becomes muddy, the water is darker; therefore, the water will warm up faster than many other sections of the lake.
So, the water is starting to warm up in the Kings river in early spring, and I Start fishing for Largemouth bass. Prior to spring the lake water is around mid to low forties. The bass are out in the deeper waters and have not moved into this shallower part of the lake. As the water progressively get warmer, the bass will move from the depths of 40 foot or deeper to 20 foot or shallower. They start moving from those deeper depths when the water gets over 50 degrees. In addition, their feeding habits change. Rather the feeding on shad or small bait fish, they start the feed on crawl fish.
